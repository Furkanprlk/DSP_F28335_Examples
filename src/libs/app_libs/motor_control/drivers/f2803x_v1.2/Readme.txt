Driver Usage Notes, March 29 2010

The drivers included in the folder initiate the peripherals for the HV Motor control + PFC Kit rev5.

These drivers can be easily changed to match peripheral mapping for other custom design boards by substituting 
the appropriate PWM and ADC channel or GPIO number in the files.

For other C2000 developement kits using these drivers please see the kit specific project folder for the modified driver. 
The drivers are renamed to avoid conflict in the project specific folder as follows

	f2803xbldcpwm_{Kit Name}.h and similar
