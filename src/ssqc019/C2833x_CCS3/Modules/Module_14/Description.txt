For standalone embedded control applications, we need to store our control code in NON-Volatile memory. This way it will be available immediately after system power-up.
The F2833x is also equipped with an internal Flash memory of 256K x 16 bits. This is quite a large amount of memory and more than sufficient for our lab exercises! Before we can go to modify one of our existing lab solutions to start up out of Flash memory, we have to go through a short explanation of how to use this memory. This module also covers the boot sequence of the F2833x - what happens when we power on the F2833x? This chapter also covers the password feature of the F2833x code security module. This module is used to embed dedicated portions of the F2833x memory in a secure section with a 128 bit-password. If the user does not know the correct combination that was programmed into the password section, any access to the secured areas will be denied! This is a security measure to prevent reverse-engineering.
