In Chapter 14 we discussed the option to start our embedded control program directly from the F2833x internal Flash memory. Another important task of a real-world project is to update parts of the internal FLASH whilst the control code is still running in FLASH memory. Texas Instruments provides an “Application Programmers Interface” (API) - library for such purposes. The API is free for download from Texas Instruments website (www.ti.com). There are different versions of this library, depending on the type of device. For the F2833x, the literature number is “SPRC539” and for the F2823x it can be found under “SPRC665”. For the laboratory exercise at the end of this chapter it is necessary that you have installed the correct library on your PC. The default installation path is either: "C:\tidcs\c28\Flash28_API\Flash28335_API_V210\"  or "C:\tidcs\c28\Flash28_API\Flash28332_API_V210". If the library is not already present on your PC, download the corresponding latest archive file from the website, unzip and install it on your PC.
