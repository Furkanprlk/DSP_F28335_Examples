You probably know that the ‘native’ numbering scheme for a digital controller is binary numbers. Unfortunately, all process values are either in the format of integer or real numbers. Depending on how a processor deals with these numbers in its translation into binary numbers, we distinguish between two basic types of processor core: Floating-point Processors & Fixed-point Processors
This chapter will start with a brief comparison between the two types of processor. Next, we will look into the different options to use both the floating-point and fixed-point units of the F2833x. This device can perform various types of mathematical operations in a very efficient way, using only a few machine clock cycles.
