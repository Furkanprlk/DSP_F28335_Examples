This chapter describes the Serial Communication Interface (SCI) module. This serial I/O port permits asynchronous communication between the F2833x and other peripheral devices. It is usually known as a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) and is often used according to the RS232 standard. 
The SCI receiver and transmitter each have a 16-deep FIFO for reducing servicing overhead, each with its own separate enable and interrupt bits. Both can be operated independently for half-duplex communication, or simultaneously for full-duplex communication. To maintain data integrity, the SCI checks received data for break detection, parity, overrun, and framing errors. The bit rate is programmable for different communication speeds through a 16-bit baud-select register. Parity checking and data formatting can also be done by the SCI port hardware, further reducing the software overhead.
