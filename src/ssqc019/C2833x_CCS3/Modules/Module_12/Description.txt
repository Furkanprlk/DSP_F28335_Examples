This module discusses the features and operation of the inter-integrated circuit (I2C) module that is available on the F2833x digital signal controller (DSC). The I2C module provides an interface between DSCs and devices compliant with Philips Semiconductors Inter-IC bus (I2C-bus) specification version 2.1 and connected by way of an I2C-bus. External components attached to this 2-wire serial bus can transmit and/or receive data between 1-bit and 8-bits to/from the F2833x through the I2C module. This student guide assumes the reader is somewhat familiar with the I2C-bus specification.
For data communication, the I2C module has a serial data pin (SDA) and a serial clock pin (SCL). The SDA and SCL pins both are bidirectional. They must each be connected to a positive 3.3 V supply voltage using pull-up resistors. When the bus is free, both pins are high. The driver of these two pins has an open-drain configuration to perform the required wired-AND function. The F2833x includes internal pull-up resistors for SDA and SCL, which can be enabled during the setup of the GPIO - pins.
