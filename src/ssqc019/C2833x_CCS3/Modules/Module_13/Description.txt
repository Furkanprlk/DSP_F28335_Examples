The Multi Channel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP) is a synchronous serial data communication channel for high-speed data transfer between the F2833x and external serial devices. It is quite often used to directly connect Audio - or Video - Codec's to an F2833x system. The 2833x device provides up to two high-speed multichannel buffered serial ports (McBSPs). An independent clock signal (CLK(R/X) for receiver and transmitter can be generated by the F2833x (master - mode) or by the external device (slave - mode). A frame sync signal (FS(R/X) indicates the beginning of a new data sequence (frame). Such a frame contains between 1 and 128 words (or channels); a word is a number of bits (8, 12, 16, 20, 24 or 32). The serial data streams are available on the “Data Transmit” (DX) and “Data Receive” (DR) pins. A hardware compression and expanding technique by coding standards “A - law” (US and Japan) or “µ - law” (Europe) can be included into the transmission path. The specifications for µ-law and A-law log PCM are part of the CCITT G.711 recommendation.
