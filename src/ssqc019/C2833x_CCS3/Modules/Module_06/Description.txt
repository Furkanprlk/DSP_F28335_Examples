This module is used to explain the interrupt system of the F2833x Digital Signal Controller. Interrupts are defined as asynchronous events, generated by an external or internal hardware unit. An event causes the controller to interrupt the execution of the current program and to start a service routine, which is dedicated to this event. After the execution of this interrupt service routine, the program that was interrupted will be resumed. The quicker a CPU performs this “task-switch”, the more this controller is suited for real-time control. After going through this chapter, you will be able to understand the F2833x interrupt system. At the end of this chapter, we will perform an exercise with a program controlled by interrupts that uses one of the 3 core timers of the CPU. The core timer’s period interrupt will be used to perform a periodic task.
