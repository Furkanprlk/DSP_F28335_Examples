In this module, we will look into an application that is not usually considered to be the domain of Digital Signal Processors: real-time control of electrical motors. In the old days, the control of speed and torque of electrical motors was performed using purely analog technology. Since the appearance of microprocessors, more and more control units have been designed digitally, using the advantages of digital systems. This improves the degree of efficiency and allows the implementation of more advanced control schemes, thanks to increased real-time computing power. It is a natural progression to use the internal hardware computing units of a DSP to transfer the calculation from a standard microprocessor to a DSP.  This way, we can implement more advanced algorithms in a given tine period.  
Chapter 18 is based on a Texas Instruments Presentation “TIs C2000 Real-Time MCU for Digital Motor Control“(August 2009). Depending on the laboratory equipment at your university, you might be offered the chance to attend a laboratory session to build a working solution for such a motor control.
