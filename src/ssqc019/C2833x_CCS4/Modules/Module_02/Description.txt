The TMS320F2833x Digital Signal Controller is capable of executing six basic operations in a single instruction cycle, and therefore the architecture of the device must reflect this feature in some way. Remember this key point when we look into the details of this Digital Signal Controller (DSC).  It will help you to understand the ‘philosophy’ behind the device with its different hardware units. Doing six basic maths operations is no magic; we will find all the hardware modules that are required to do so in this chapter.
