Welcome to the Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 Tutorial. This material is intended to be used as a student guide for a series of lessons and lab exercises dedicated to the TMS320F28335 Digital Signal Controller. The series of modules will guide you through the various elements of this device, as well as train you in using Texas Instruments development tools and additional resources from the Internet. 
The material should be used for undergraduate classes at university. A basic knowledge of microprocessor architecture and programming microprocessors in language C is necessary.  The material in Modules 1 to 10 shall be used in one semester, accompanied by lab exercises in parallel. Each module includes a detailed lab procedure for self study and guidance during the lab sessions.
The experimental lab sessions are based on the Texas Instruments “Peripheral Explorer Board” (TI part number: TMDSPREX28335). A 32K code-size limited version of the software design suite “Code Composer Studio” that is bundled with the Peripheral Explorer Board is used for the development of code examples. 
Modules 11 to 19 of the series go deeper into details of the TMS320F28335. They cover more advanced subjects and can be seen as an optional series of lessons.
