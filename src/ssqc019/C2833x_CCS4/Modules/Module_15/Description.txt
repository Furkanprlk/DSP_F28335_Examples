Because we have already dealt with the Flash start option in Chapter 14, we can now focus on the serial boot loader options.  Five options are available: Serial Communication Interface (SCI), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C), Controller Area Network (CAN) used for motor vehicles and Multi Channel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP). All five interfaces were discussed in detail in Chapters 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. If you have finished the lab exercises of some of these five modules successfully, you should be able to develop your own code to download code from a PC as host into the SARAM of the F2833x and start it from there. 
A typical application for the serial download of new code into the F2833x is a field update of the internal Flash memory that contains the control code for the embedded system. It would be much too expensive to use the JTAG - Emulator to download the new code. Instead, Texas Instruments offers a Flash API that uses exactly the same SCI boot load option to transmit the new code and/or data into the F2833x. This API - a portion of code that will be part of your project will take care of the code update.
