Today’s electronic systems are described using terms such as “direct digital control”, “digital power supply”, “digital power converters” and so on. A core feature of all these applications is the ability to generate different series of digital pulse patterns to control power electronic switches based on the results of sophisticated numerical calculations. The F283xx family provides such hardware units; several pulse width modulation (PWM) output signals, along with time measurements units (“Capture Units”). A third hardware part of the Control System is called a ‘Quadrature Encoder Pulse’ -unit (QEP). This is a unit that is used to derive the speed and direction information of a rotating shaft directly from hardware signals from incremental encoders or resolvers. Our lab series Lab 7-1 to Lab 7-9 will include the most important operating modes of a PWM signal. A typical requirement in control loop calculations is the operation using complex numbers, which are translated according to Euler's law into sine and cosine components. Instead of calculating a new sine-value each time we need one, we can access a look-up table, which is already available inside the F283xx! This is exactly what we will do in Lab 7- 9 (“Generate a pulse width modulated sine wave signal”) to implement a practical example.
