Chapter 12 introduces Texas Instruments Built-In Operating System (“BIOS”) for Digital Signal Processors - “DSP/BIOS”. This firmware will allow you to use a range of a Real Time Operating System (“RTOS”) features in an embedded control application. It is not the intention of this module to cover the theory of Operating Systems and the specific demands of a real time control application. To be able to work with all options of DSP/BIOS it will be necessary for you to enrol in additional classes about this topic at your university. When you have completed these classes, it is highly recommended to return to this module after you are familiar with the theory of multi processing and real time control. With this knowledge you can enhance the examples shown in this chapter to their full extend.
