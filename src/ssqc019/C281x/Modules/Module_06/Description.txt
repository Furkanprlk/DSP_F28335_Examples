An Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) provides an important interface between the controller an the real world. Most physical signals such as temperature, humidity, pressure, current, speed, acceleration are analogue signals. Almost all of these can be represented as an electrical voltage between Vmin and Vmax, e.g. 0...3V, which is proportional to the original signal. The purpose of the ADC is to convert this analogue voltage in a digital number.
