You know that the ‘native’ numbering scheme for a digital controller uses binary numbers. Unfortunately, all process values are either in the format of integer or real numbers. Depending on how a processor deals with these numbers in its translation into binary numbers, we distinguish between two basic types of processor core:
Floating-point Processors * Fixed-point Processors
This chapter will start with a brief comparison between the two types of processor. Because the C28x belongs to the fixed-point type we will focus on this type more in detail. After a brief discussion about binary numbers we will have a look into the different options to use the fixed-point unit of the C28x. It can perform various types of mathematical operations in a very efficient way, using only a few machine clock cycles.
