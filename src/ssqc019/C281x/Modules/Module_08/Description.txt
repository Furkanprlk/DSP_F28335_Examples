The Serial Communication Interface(SCI) module is a serial I/O port that permits asynchronous communication between the C28x and other peripheral devices. It is usually known as a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) and is used according to the RS232 standard. To allow for efficent CPU usage, the SCI  transmit and receive registers are both FIFO-buffered to prevent data collisions. In addition, the C28x SCI has a full duplex interface, which provides for simultaneous data transmit and receive. Parity checking and data formatting can also be done by the SCI port hardware, further reducing software overhead.
