Since a Digital Signal Processor is capable of executing six basic operations in a single instruction cycle, the architecture of the TMS320F2812 must reflect this feature in some way. Recall this key point when we look into the details of this Digital Signal Controller (DSC).  It will help you to understand the ‘philosophy’ behind the device with its different hardware units. Doing six basic math's operations is no magic; we will find all the hardware modules that are required to do so in this chapter.
