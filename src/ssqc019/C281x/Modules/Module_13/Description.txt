We start with a summary of the six options to start the C28x out of RESET, followed by a look into the firmware structure inside the C28x Boot-ROM. This includes some lookup tables for mathematical operations, a generic interrupt vector table and the code that is used to select one of the six start options.
Because we have already dealt with the Flash start option in chapter 10, we can now focus on the serial boot loader options.  Two options are available: Serial Communication Interface (SCI) and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Both interfaces were discussed in detail in module 7 and 8. If you have finished the lab exercises of these two modules successfully, you should be able to develop your own code to download code from a PC as host into the SARAM of the C28x and start it from there.
