This chapter looks into one of the most common applications for Digital Signal Processors: “Digital Filters”. As we have seen before, there are two basic classes of computing: “off — line” and “real — time”. This is also valid for digital signal processing. Because we are dealing with the C28x controller, which is designed for  embedded control, calculations are usually done in a real time environment. For a digital filter, this means that all internal processing of the current state of a system must be finished before a next input value is sampled. Again, computing time is most precious! The faster we calculate the algorithm of a digital filter, the more samples we can take from an input channel. It also means that the frequency of the input signal that is to be processed depends directly on the efficiency of the controller.
