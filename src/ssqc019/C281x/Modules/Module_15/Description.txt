In this module, we will look into an application area that is not usually the domain of Digital Signal Processors: real-time control of electrical motors. In the old days, control of the speed and torque of electrical motors was done purely using analog technology. Since the appearance of microprocessors, more and more control units have been designed digitally, using the advantages of digital systems. This improves the degree of efficiency and allows the implementation of more advanced control schemes, thanks to increase real-time computing power. It is a natural progression to use the internal hardware computing units of a DSP to transfer the calculation from a standard microprocessor to a DSP. This way, we can implement more advanced algorithms in a given period of time.
