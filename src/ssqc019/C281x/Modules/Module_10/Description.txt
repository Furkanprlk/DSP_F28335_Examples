For standalone embedded control applications, we need to store our control code in  NON-Volatile memory. The F2812 is equipped with an internal Flash memory area of 128Kx16.
Chapter 10 also covers the password feature of the C28x code security module. This module is used to embed dedicated portions of the C28x memory in a secure section with a 128bit-password. If the user does not know the correct combination that was programmed into the password section any access to the secured areas will be denied! This is a security measure to prevent revers-engineering.
