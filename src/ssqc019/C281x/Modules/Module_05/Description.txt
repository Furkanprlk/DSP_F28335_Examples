One of the most powerful hardware modules of the C28x is called ‘The Event Manager (EV)’. An EV is a unit that is able to deal with different types of time-based procedures. The core of this manager is a little bit similar to the DSP’s core timer units Timer 0, 1 and 2. Although the Event Manager Timer units are also called "Timer 1, 2, 3 and 4", these timers are totally independent of the three core timers. So please do not mix them up! From now, when we speak of a timer unit, we have to clarify if it is a Core timer or an Event Manager timer!
