With any language version of Acrobat Reader 5.0, you can display Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files that contain text in Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). All you need to do is install the appropriate Asian font pack for use with Acrobat Reader. The Asian Language Support installers are available on the Adobe Acrobat 5.0 product CD, or from Adobe's web site at:<br>			<a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/cjkfontpack.html">http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/cjkfontpack.html</a><br>			<br>									STSong&#153; is a trademark of ChangZhou SinoType Technology Co., Ltd<br>			<br>			<a name="Anchor-Troubleshooting-46919"></a><b><font size="+2">Troubleshooting Issues<br>				</font></b></p>		<p><br>			<b>Using Acrobat 4.x or Acrobat Reader 4.x to view and print files created in Acrobat 5.0<br>			</b>			You can use Acrobat 4.x or Acrobat Reader 4.x to view and print PDF files created with Acrobat 5.0, taking note of the following:<br>			-PDF files with 128-bit encryption will not open in Acrobat 4.x,<br>			-Transparency is not supported in Acrobat 4.0; PDF files containing such graphics can only be fully appreciated in Acrobat 5.0,<br>			-Scanned PDF files which use JBIG2 compression will not open in Acrobat 4.x,<br>			-Acrobat 5 enables any font on your system to be used in a Free Text annotation. However, Acrobat 4.x allowed only the base PostScript Roman fonts and the Heisei Japanese fonts.  If a Japanese Free Text annotation is created in Acrobat 5.0 using fonts other than the Japanese Heisei fonts, this text annotation will not be displayed correctly on Acrobat 4.x, [397619]<br>-PDF files that contain new JavaScript operators may issue errors to the JavaScript console if run in Acrobat 4.0.<br>-PDF files whose fonts use new predefined CMaps may not open properly in Acrobat 4.0<br>-Some forms created in Acrobat 5.0 may generate FDF data that cannot be parsed correctly by server-side CGI scripts written with the Acrobat 4.0 FDF Toolkit<br>-Acrobat Form fields in Acrobat 4.x supported only a limited number of fonts. While the forms tool in Acrobat 5.0 enables you to specify any font in a form field, Acrobat 4.x may not display such a form correctly.[397754, 312623,410665]<br>			<br>			<b>Using the Toolbar<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>Acrobat Reader's toolbars can be torn-off, docked on the top, and their geometry may be changed. Torn-off toolbars cannot be combined by dragging the title bar of the toolbar; use the drag handle of the toolbar instead.[398112]<br>			<br>			<b>Viewing PDF files within Internet Explorer and Netscape</b><br>			When attempting to view relatively large PDF files, you may see an error message saying &quot;Page processing error. File input/output error. Time out during connecting.&quot; Other symptoms that you may see are Acrobat Reader displays blank pages or Acrobat Reader may hang. Check with your systems or network administrator that the version of Apache being used is 1.3.17 or greater. Acrobat Reader may exhibit the symptoms listed above with earlier versions of Apache.[417553]<br>			<br>			<b>Accessibility</b><br>			An expanded version of Acrobat Reader for Windows includes support for the visually impaired. To determine if your copy of Acrobat Reader has accessibility functions, check for the presence of the MSAA plug-in in the Help &gt; About Adobe Acrobat Plug-ins dialog.<br>			<br>			<b>Accessibility - </b><b>Using Reflow with a screen reader</b><br>			For reliable results with a screen reader, only reflow documents that are not being delivered to the screen reader one page at a time. You can control how documents are delivered to the screen reader by setting the Content Delivery preference in the Accessibility preference panel. [418683]<br>			<br>			<b>America On Line - Displaying PDF files on Windows 95 with America On Line 6</b><br>			On Windows 95, clicking on a link to a PDF file within America On Line 6 with Internet Explorer 5.5 installed may take two-four minutes to load. Please use Internet Explorer or Netscape if you have that option.[412577]<br>			<br>			<b>America On Line - Using File &gt; Open in America On Line 6.0 will open a PDF file in a text editor.</b><br>			When you go through the steps you are informed by a dialog box that the PDF file is not a recognized file type and will be opened in a text editor. To view a PDF file that is on your hard drive or LAN, just select it in Windows Explorer and Acrobat Reader will be launched and will load the file.[405406, 406627]<br>			<br>			<b>Chinese, Korean, and Japanese (CJK) Acrobat Substitution Fonts<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>Attempting to activate by Adobe Type Manager and use the Acrobat CJK substitution fonts that are installed by Acrobat (for example, KozMinPro-Regular-Acro.otf) is not recommended and results may be unpredictable.[390851]<br>			<br>			<b>CJK Text Display in Acrobat Reader Dialogs<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>On a Roman system, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese (CJK) text cannot be displayed in Acrobat Reader dialogs. Acrobat Reader requires a CJK system with the appropriate CJK system font in order to display CJK characters in its dialogs.[395326]<br>			<br>			<b>CJK Text Display when Overprint Preview is on<br>			</b>When a PDF containing CJK characters that have a relatively complicated glyph design, is viewed with Overprint Preview turned on, the text may look less clear than when Overprint Preview is turned off.[416395]<br>			<br>			<b>CJK Text Display of bolded text when magnification is applied</b><br>			Some CJK bolded characters may be blurred if the original application created the bolded text with synthetic bolding. If the Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel are turned off, when the document is magnified you may see some white areas or cracks. Acrobat 4.x writes a character four times to achieve bolding, and for some documents, such text may appear as four lines of text instead of appearing as bold text.  In Acrobat 5.0, synthetic bolding is used. Adobe recommends turning on the Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel to avoid seeing white areas or cracks when the bolded text is magnified. [418447] <br>			<br>			<b>CJK Forms<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>						On a system which does not have Asian Language Support installed, if you open a CJK Forms PDF which contains differently encoded CJK characters than those the Form was created with, the CJK Form fields will not be displayed correctly. Most Form fields will not appear at all. To prevent this, be sure to install Asian Language Support on systems that will be viewing and using CJK Forms. See this ReadMe's section titled &quot;Installing Asian Language Files for Acrobat Reader 5.0&quot; above for additional information. [412829]<b><font size="+1"><br>				</font></b><br>			<b>Create Adobe PDF Online and Search Adobe PDF Online require Winsock2<br>			</b>									These functions available on the Tools menu require Winsock2. When Winsock2 is not available these functions do not appear. On Windows operating systems except Windows 95, Winsock2 is available because it is installed by either Internet Explorer 4 or Internet Explorer 5. To make Web Services available on Windows 95 install Winsock2 available from Microsoft.[390722]<b><font size="+1"><br>				</font></b><br>			<b>Debugging with Acrobat Reader 5.0</b><br>						If you need to use a debugger while Acrobat Reader 5.0 is running, to enable debugging remove the InterTrust directory and DocBox.api plug-in contained within it from the Acrobat 5.0/Reader/Plug_ins directory. [416341]<br>			<br>			<b>Extract Images Preference</b><br>			In the Acrobat Help section titled &quot;Setting Acrobat Preferences&quot;, the Extract Images preference is defined incorrectly. The Help states the preference &quot;Defines the minimum size an image must be to display on screen&quot;. The Extract Image preference actually defines to Acrobat the minimum size an image must be in order for Acrobat to extract it from a PDF. [417231]<br>			<br>			<b>Find Dialog - </b><b>Using Find to Locate</b><b> </b><b>Unicode Characters</b><br>			You can use Find to locate Unicode characters within a PDF document. To do this, add a &quot;\u&quot; in front of the Unicode character for which you want to search. For example, to search for the Unicode equivalent of the ASCII character &quot;A&quot; , enter &quot;\u0041&quot; in the Find dialog. For some CJK characters, such as Unicode &quot;4e01&quot;, you can specify &quot;\u4e01&quot;.[413632]<br>			<br>			<b>Acrobat 5 support for the Hong Kong Supplemental Character Set</b><br>			The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government recently introduced the Hong Kong Supplemental Character Set (HKSCS). Acrobat 5 allows you to view and print PDF files containing HKSCS characters on all supported Windows operating systems supported by Acrobat 5.0 (see the System Requirements section). If you would like to view or print PDF files that contain text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the Chinese Traditional Language Pack.[418559]<br>			<br>			<b>Hong Kong Character Set and Comments and Bookmarks<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>Acrobat Reader 5.0 supports the Hong Kong character set for text in a PDF file. It is an extension to the Adobe Chinese Traditional character set. If you would like to view PDF files that contain text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the Chinese Traditional Language Pack. Since the Hong Kong character set is not part of the standard system fonts you will not be able to comment or create bookmarks using Hong Kong characters.[407877]<br>			<br>			<b>Installing Acrobat 3.x or 4.x After Installing Acrobat Reader 5.0<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>If you install Acrobat 3.x or 4.x after installing Acrobat Reader  5.0, Acrobat Reader will be unexpectedly launched every time a folder is opened in Windows Explorer. To avoid this problem, always uninstall Acrobat Reader 5.0 before installing an older version of Acrobat.[400589]<br>			<br>			<b>Movie Plug-in - viewing a movie in a floating window<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>			When viewing a movie that plays in a floating window, you can stop the movie at any time by pressing the Escape key.[410153]<br>			<br>			<b>Movie Plug-in - Remote URL requires QuickTime 4 or later</b>			<br>				If you will be using the Movie tool to view Movies by pressing a link to a remote link, be sure to have QuickTime 4 or later installed on your system. [418201]			<br>			<br>			<b>Netscape 6<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>Acrobat Reader installs a plug-in to work with Netscape 4.x browsers. This plug-in enables users to download, view, navigate and print Adobe PDF files, and to fill in PDF forms while working inside the browser. With Netscape 6, PDF files must be downloaded in their entirety before they can be viewed.<br>			<br>			<b>Nvidia TNT graphics card with True (32-bit) color set</b><br>If you are using a Nvidia TNT graphics card and your display is set to use True (32-bit) color, you may experience a general protection fault crash in Module NVDISP.drv. The crash will occur if the Opacity setting in the Comments preferences is set to less than 100% and there are one or more Comment popup windows overlapping. You can avoid the problem by setting the Opacity in the Comments Preferences to 100% or by setting the display to 16-bit color (in the Display Control Panel). Please check the Nvidia web site for a driver update that may solve this problem. [419590]<br>			<br>			<b>Printing ImageType 4 files to Lexmark printers</b><br>						Image Type 4 is a feature of PostScript 3. While application software creates ImageType 4 files somewhat infrequently, a PDF created from a GIF file with transparency using Acrobat WebCapture will contain ImageType 4.<br>						When files containing ImageType 4 are printed to the Lexmark printers listed below, the printer may hang and no output is produced. The Lexmark printer models are: <br>						-Lexmark Optra C710 PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS revision 2000411<br>						-Lexmark Optra W810PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS revision 990917<br>			<br>						To work around this problem, you have two options: <br>						1. Choose Print As Image from the Print dialog. This will produce results similar to what you see on the screen.<br>						2. If your platform is Windows, you can change the Print Method from Language Level 3 to Language Level 2. However, on the Macintosh, there is no Print Method field. To get the same effect, you could edit the PPD file to make it reflect language level 2, for example, change:<br>						*PSVersion: &quot;(3010.010)&quot;<br>						to:<br>						*PSVersion: &quot;(2014.700)&quot;<br>						Do not change your PPD file if Print As Image produces the desired results. Forcing the file to print at language level 2 enables Image Type 4 to print, but all transparency will be lost.[416539]<br>			<br>			<b>Printing smooth shades to the HP4050N</b><br>								Smooth shades may be clipped when you print to the HP4050N printer using HP's PCL 6 printer driver. You may want to try printing such files with HP's PCL 5e driver. [418321]<br>			<br>			<b>Reflow<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>			Documents cannot be reflowed at certain magnification and window width combinations. Acrobat Reader magnifies the document to whatever magnification level it can display without failing. [401685]<br>			<br>			<b>Save A Copy<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>Acrobat Reader 5.0 contains a menu item and a toolbar icon called &quot;Save A Copy&quot;. If you modify an Adobe PDF file in Acrobat Reader 5.0, your changes will not be preserved when you use this command. Only a copy of the original Adobe PDF file will be saved; saving updates is not a feature of Acrobat Reader.[414048]<br>			<br>			<b>Scalable Vector Graphics (</b><b>SVG) browser plugin needs Administrator to accept the End User License Agreement<br>			</b>If installing Acrobat 5 onto a windows terminal server or a locked down NT/2000 system, the SVG browser plugin will not work until the administrator visits an SVG site, such as Adobe's SVG demonstration page:<br>			<br>			    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/demos/">http://www.adobe.com/svg/demos/</a><br>			<br>			Until then, users with non-administrative permissions who visit an SVG enabled web page will notice multiple End User license agreement dialogs, and the page will not view correctly.[418523]<br>			<br>			<b>WebBuy on Windows 2000<font size="+1"><br>				</font></b>On Windows 2000, Service Pack 1 is required for WebBuy to show a Zip drive as a device in:<br>									Edit-&gt;Preferences&gt;General&gt;WebBuy&gt;Select Other Identifiers. [390998]<br>			<br>			<b>WebBuy on Windows 2000 on a system with multiple processors<br>			</b>If you buy an electronic book using WebBuy from one processor and later attempt to access the book from another processor you will be denied access. This may happen, for example, if you purchase the electronic book from one log-in and later attempt to access it from another log-in. To prevent this, use the same log-in to access the book as that used to purchase the book.[413006]<br>			<br>			<b>WebBuy requires the latest Iomega drivers</b>			<br>									Be sure to install the latest Iomega drivers for all Jaz, Clik! or Zip drives if you want to use the media for these drives as identifiers for WebBuy. Even if your system recognizes the drives, WebBuy will only recognize the media for licensing if the Iomega drivers have been installed.[413448]<br>			<br>			<b>Using Windows Internet Explorer</b><br>			If you install Acrobat 4.x after Acrobat Reader 5.0, The Acrobat 4.x ActiveX Control will be used with the browser. Because an Acrobat Reader 5.0 registry setting exists, Internet Explorer will always launch Acrobat 4 when it starts. To avoid this problem, uninstall Acrobat Reader 5.0 before installing Acrobat 4.x. [366101]<br>			<br>			<b>Windows XP and Acrobat Reader 5.0<br>			</b>Acrobat Reader 5.0 is not certified to run on Windows XP, as the final version of this operating system was not available for testing during Acrobat Reader 5.0's development. However, if compatibility problems with this operating system are found Adobe intends to develop an update release of Acrobat Reader 5.0 that will address the incompatibilities.<br>			<br>									======================================================================<br>						Copyright &copy; 1987-2001 Adobe Systems Incorporated and its licensors.
